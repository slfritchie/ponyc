  """
  A TCP connection. When connecting, the Happy Eyeballs algorithm is used.

  The following code creates a client that connects to port 8989 of
  the local host, writes "hello world", and listens for a response,
  which it then prints.

  ```pony
  use "net"

  class MyTCPConnectionNotify is TCPConnectionNotify
    let _out: OutStream

    new create(out: OutStream) =>
      _out = out

    fun ref connected(conn: TCPConnection ref) =>
      conn.write("hello world")

    fun ref received(
      conn: TCPConnection ref,
      data: Array[U8] iso,
      times: USize)
      : Bool
    =>
      _out.print("GOT:" + String.from_array(consume data))
      conn.close()
      true

    fun ref connect_failed(conn: TCPConnection ref) =>
      None

  actor Main
    new create(env: Env) =>
      try
        TCPConnection(env.root as AmbientAuth,
          recover MyTCPConnectionNotify(env.out) end, "", "8989")
      end
  ```

  Note: when writing to the connection data will be silently discarded if the
  connection has not yet been established.

  ## Backpressure support

  ### Write

  The TCP protocol has built-in backpressure support. This is generally
  experienced as the outgoing write buffer becoming full and being unable
  to write all requested data to the socket. In `TCPConnection`, this is
  hidden from the programmer. When this occurs, `TCPConnection` will buffer
  the extra data until such time as it is able to be sent. Left unchecked,
  this could result in uncontrolled queuing. To address this,
  `TCPConnectionNotify` implements two methods `throttled` and `unthrottled`
  that are called when backpressure is applied and released.

  Upon receiving a `throttled` notification, your application has two choices
  on how to handle it. One is to inform the Pony runtime that it can no
  longer make progress and that runtime backpressure should be applied to
  any actors sending this one messages. For example, you might construct your
  application like:

  ```pony
  // Here we have a TCPConnectionNotify that upon construction
  // is given a BackpressureAuth token. This allows the notifier
  // to inform the Pony runtime when to apply and release backpressure
  // as the connection experiences it.
  // Note the calls to
  //
  // Backpressure.apply(_auth)
  // Backpressure.release(_auth)
  //
  // that apply and release backpressure as needed

  use "backpressure"
  use "collections"
  use "net"

  class SlowDown is TCPConnectionNotify
    let _auth: BackpressureAuth
    let _out: StdStream

    new iso create(auth: BackpressureAuth, out: StdStream) =>
      _auth = auth
      _out = out

    fun ref throttled(connection: TCPConnection ref) =>
      _out.print("Experiencing backpressure!")
      Backpressure.apply(_auth)

    fun ref unthrottled(connection: TCPConnection ref) =>
      _out.print("Releasing backpressure!")
      Backpressure.release(_auth)

    fun ref connect_failed(conn: TCPConnection ref) =>
      None

  actor Main
    new create(env: Env) =>
      try
        let auth = env.root as AmbientAuth
        let socket = TCPConnection(auth, recover SlowDown(auth, env.out) end,
          "", "7669")
      end

  ```

  Or if you want, you could handle backpressure by shedding load, that is,
  dropping the extra data rather than carrying out the send. This might look
  like:

  ```pony
  use "net"

  class ThrowItAway is TCPConnectionNotify
    var _throttled: Bool = false

    fun ref sent(conn: TCPConnection ref, data: ByteSeq): ByteSeq =>
      if not _throttled then
        data
      else
        ""
      end

    fun ref sentv(conn: TCPConnection ref, data: ByteSeqIter): ByteSeqIter =>
      if not _throttled then
        data
      else
        recover Array[String] end
      end

    fun ref throttled(connection: TCPConnection ref) =>
      _throttled = true

    fun ref unthrottled(connection: TCPConnection ref) =>
      _throttled = false

    fun ref connect_failed(conn: TCPConnection ref) =>
      None

  actor Main
    new create(env: Env) =>
      try
        TCPConnection(env.root as AmbientAuth,
          recover ThrowItAway end, "", "7669")
      end
  ```

  In general, unless you have a very specific use case, we strongly advise that
  you don't implement a load shedding scheme where you drop data.

  ### Read

  If your application is unable to keep up with data being sent to it over
  a `TCPConnection` you can use the builtin read backpressure support to
  pause reading the socket which will in turn start to exert backpressure on
  the corresponding writer on the other end of that socket.

  The `mute` behavior allow any other actors in your application to request
  the cessation of additional reads until such time as `unmute` is called.
  Please note that this cessation is not guaranteed to happen immediately as
  it is the result of an asynchronous behavior call and as such will have to
  wait for existing messages in the `TCPConnection`'s mailbox to be handled.

  On non-windows platforms, your `TCPConnection` will not notice if the
  other end of the connection closes until you unmute it. Unix type systems
  like FreeBSD, Linux and OSX learn about a closed connection upon read. On
  these platforms, you **must** call `unmute` on a muted connection to have
  it close. Without calling `unmute` the `TCPConnection` actor will never
  exit.
